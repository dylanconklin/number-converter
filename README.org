* Overview

This is a simple command line utility that converts numbers between bases, such as base2, base10, base8 or base16.

By default, there is support for up to base16, with the number 0-9, and the letters A-F. This is arbitrary, and you can add as many different characters as you'd like to support a higher base number.

* Usage

The program takes 3 parameters: the original number, the original number's base, and the new number's base.

So if I wanted to convert the base 2 (binary) 10101010 to base 10 (decimal), I would type:

#+begin_example
$ ./a.out 10101010 2 10
#+end_example

If I wanted to convert the base 16 (hexidecimal) number FF to base 10 (decimal), I would type:

#+begin_example
$ ./a.out FF 16 10
#+end_example

And if I wanted to convert the base 8 (octal) 76327663 to base 16 (hexidecimal), I would type:

#+begin_example
$ ./a.out 76327663 8 26
#+end_example
